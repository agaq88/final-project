		<h2>Story so far</h2>

		<p> Legend holds that the world's first marathon was run — unintentionally — in 490 B.C. by a Greek soldier, Pheidippides, who ran the 25 miles to Athens from the town of Marathon to announce a battleground victory over the Persians. "Greetings, we win!" he shouted — and then fell to the ground, dead. It would be more than 2,000 years before the marathon would make its return, at the revival of the modern Olympic Games in Greece in 1896. In that event, 17 runners ran 40 km, or 24.8 miles, with Greek runner Spyridon Louis taking the gold medal with a time of 2 hr. 58 min. 50 sec. Inspired by the event's success, Boston inaugurated its race the next year; it is now the oldest annual marathon in the world. In 1908, the marathon course at the London Olympics ran from Windsor Castle to the royal box at the Olympic stadium in White City (some sources say the Princess of Wales wanted her children to watch the start of the race from their home). The length of the race continued varying for years, but in 1924 that specific distance — 42,195 m, or 26 miles, 385 yd. — was made the worldwide standard. </p>

			<p class="hide_column" id="show-this-on-click1"> The athletes involved in the project will need to be on an optimal daily diet. Specifically, nutritional analyses will be done and it will be ensured that the athletes have the recommended daily nutrition, with particular attention paid to daily intake of protein and carbohydrate to ensure enough fuel substrate for intensive training and protein to aid recovery. It may be found, for example, that some athletes have sufficient carbohydrate, but sub-optimal protein intake. The project dietician will then address such an issue. Other issues would be to ensure the adequate intake of vitamins, minerals, and micro-nutrients. <br><br>
				"In race” ingestion of fluid and carbohydrate needs to be addressed. As with so many of the other issues that need to be optimised for best possible performance, the volume of fluid ingested, the time interval of ingestion, and the carbohydrate type and amount ingested will all have to be investigated and the current practice of each athlete evaluated against what is considered optimal, and then within the boundaries of practicality (it might not be possible to ingest the “recommended optimal” amount of carbohydrate when running at just over 21km/hr!), an optimal strategy worked out for each athlete to use during races.</p>

			<p class="hide_column" id="show-this-on-click2">Racing speeds are largely determined by the forces between a runner’s foot and the ground.  Accordingly, smashing the marathon’s speed/time barriers will require the breakthrough athlete to “pound the pavement” at unprecedented levels.  The crucial mechanical variable is how much force the athlete can repeatedly apply to the ground in relation to body mass over the course of a race. The field of biomechanics is nearing the ability to concisely link the gait mechanics of individual runners to the ground forces they apply. 
					<br><br>
					The biomechanics portion of the 2-hour marathon project will have two components: <br><br> 1) a laboratory component that will concisely link a runner’s motion to the ground forces they apply, <br><br> 2) a field component that will utilize wearable sensors and the force-motion relationship to acquire step-by-step ground reaction forces from racing athletes.</p> 

			<p class="hide_column" id="show-this-on-click3">The athlete who breaks 2 hours for the marathon will have ‘optimal’ physiology in terms of an appropriate combination of running economy, VO2 max and sustainable oxidative metabolic rate. The latter – the ‘critical’ VO2 – is related to the transport and utilisation of oxygen and requires exquisite coordination of the pulmonary, cardiovascular and muscle metabolic systems. <br><br>
				The translation of this rate of energy transfer to speed over the ground is determined by running economy which is, in turn, influenced by anthropometric, biomechanical, nutritional and physiological factors. Other energetic considerations for the 2 hour marathon include drafting, pacing and substrate utilisation. This work package will focus on the identification, training and race-specific preparation of the sub-s hour athlete.</p>
